The purpose of this project was to map which states received the most in Paycheck Protection 
Program loans, as well as mark the location of businesses that received loans.  
I used Pandas as well as the Folium library for this project. 
I was successful in generating .html files for both the heatmap and the map markers. However, 
the map markers file I created is nearly 800 mbs, after reducing it to only include loans that went to 
collections. I will add a copy of the .html files in the Maps folder in this project’s GitHub repo. 

To run this program, save all files and folders in one folder. Then, run main.py.
