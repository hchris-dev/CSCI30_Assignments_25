# PPP Loan Heatmap and Collections Markers
The purpose of this project was to map which states received the most in Paycheck Protection 
Program loans, as well as mark the location of businesses that received loans.  
I used Pandas as well as the Folium library for this project. 
I was successful in generating .html files for both the heatmap and the map markers. However, 
the map markers file I created is nearly 800 mbs, after reducing it to only include loans that went to 
collections. I will add a copy of the .html files in the Maps folder in this project’s GitHub repo. 

To run this program, save main.py and the Data folder in one folder. Then, run main.py.
