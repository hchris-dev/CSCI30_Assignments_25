# PPP Loan Heatmap and Collections Markers
The purpose of this project was to map which states received the most in Paycheck Protection 
Program loans, as well as mark the location of businesses that received loans.  
I used Pandas, Folium, and PyQt6 for this project. 

This program can generate and display maps of loan recipients in each state.

To run this program, save main.py and the Data folder in one folder. Then, run main.py.
