# Scrambled Flag Identifier

A program that goes through a list of edited images and returns an array of flags with similar qualities

Based on the article [Can You Solve The Vexing Vexillology](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-the-vexing-vexillology/)

File of Flag Details is [🌍🌍World Flags🌍🌍](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edoardoba/world-flags) : CC0: Public Domain

I made minor corrections and added Namibia


File of Flag Images is [World Countries with Flag Image/URL](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awmium/countries-by-region) : Unknown License

I modified country names so they would match the spelling used in 🌍🌍World Flags🌍🌍
